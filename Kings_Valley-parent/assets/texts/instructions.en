INSTRUCTIONS – KINGS VALLEY

GAME MODES
You can choose between the classic version, consisting of 15 levels, or the extended version, which includes 60 levels divided into 4 episodes.
After completing the game for the first time, the difficulty level selection is unlocked.
In the extended version, after completing an episode of 15 levels, you can start the game from the next episode.
During the game you can pause the game or open the map by pressing the ESCAPE key.
If the explorer becomes trapped with no way to continue, you can restart the level at the cost of one life.

GAME OBJECTIVE
Explore the ruins of the Kings Valley and collect all hidden treasures in each level.
To achieve this, you must dig tunnels, use your sword against the mummies, and avoid environmental traps.
Once all treasures have been collected, reach the exit to advance to the next level.

CONTROLS
LEFT / RIGHT ARROWS : Move the character
DIAGONAL ARROWS : Climb up or down ladders
BUTTON / SPACE BAR : Jump or use pickaxe or sword

THE EXPLORER
The explorer can:
Walk and jump across platforms
Climb up and down ladders
Dig terrain blocks using pickaxes
Attack mummies with the sword
The jump has a maximum height of two cells, which means poor planning can leave the explorer trapped with no escape.

JUMPING AND FALLING
The explorer can jump up to two cells high
Taller obstacles cannot be cleared without digging or using ladders
The explorer can fall from any height without taking damage
The danger is not the fall itself, but where you land
This rule allows long drops, but may lead to areas with no exit.

PICKAXES AND DIGGING
Pickaxes allow digging through diggable blocks
Each use consumes one pickaxe, so use them carefully
Digging is performed mainly in a vertical direction, allowing up to two cells to be destroyed downward
Only when the explorer is completely enclosed, digging is performed sideways, opening a path to one side
Digging permanently alters the level layout and must be planned carefully.

SWORDS
Swords allow you to defeat mummies
They do not wear out with use
If dropped or lost, they can be picked up again

MUMMIES AND ENEMIES
Mummies patrol the ruins and pursue the explorer
There are five different types of mummies, each with its own characteristics and difficulty level
Direct contact with a mummy causes the loss of one life
Mummies can be defeated using the sword
After a period of time, defeated mummies reappear at the location where they were eliminated
If a mummy cannot find the explorer, it may self destruct and respawn at a random position

ROTATING DOORS
Rotating doors appear in some levels
They can only be crossed in one direction
Attempting to cross from the wrong side blocks passage
Mummies cannot pass through rotating doors in any direction

TRAPS AND HAZARDS
Some levels contain trap walls that descend from the ceiling
These traps are activated by stepping on specific locations
If the explorer is caught underneath, one life is lost
Traps are not visible at first glance

TREASURES
Treasures are scattered throughout the level
Some can only be reached by digging
All treasures must be collected to activate the exit

EXITS
Exits are activated only when all treasures have been collected
Reaching an exit completes the level
Some exits allow you to return to a previous pyramid or take shortcuts
These shortcuts are available only in the extended version

LIVES AND GAME OVER
The player starts with a limited number of lives
Contact with enemies or traps reduces one life
When all lives are lost, the game ends
Earning points can grant extra lives

TIPS
Always plan how you will escape before digging or jumping
Do not underestimate the jump limitation
Use long falls to descend quickly
Watch for suspicious ceilings and passages
Carefully plan the use of pickaxes and rotating doors
